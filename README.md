# Learning Fullstack

Mini-project to learn fullstack web app development using:

- Python (backend): Flask as the web server with Gunicorn as the WSGI server.
- Typescript + React (frontend): developing static content for UI. Frontend calls backend for data.
- Nginx for reverse proxy and serving static content.
- Docker for containerization and orchestration of backend, frontend, and web server.
- EC2 for hosting the web app.
